‚ú® About Me
My name is Henrique Alexandre de Camargo. I'm currently 19 years old, born and raised in a small town called Pitanga where I currently live. I have a brother who has always been a reference for me in programming. After many comings and goings, I finally decided to pursue a career in programming.

This repository is where I'll start being a little more "official" programmer. I was learning Python in 2020 and was a good competitive player at CodinGame. However, I stopped to focus on college.

My city does not have a computer science program, and although I was accepted into four different universities, I couldn't attend any of them. I was discouraged to continue but now I want to recover everything I lost and get better.

At the time of writing this readme, I am learning JavaScript. I love artificial intelligence and machine learning, but for now, I want to work with full-stack web design and development.

I've never used GitHub, and it's sad because I lost so many Python projects. So, these will be my first steps in Git.
