<b>‚ú®&nbsp;&nbsp;About&nbsp;Me</b>
</br></br>
My name is Henrique Alexandre de Camargo, I'm currently 19 years old, I was born in a country town "Pitanga" where I'm living now, I have a brother who has always been a reference for me in programming, and after many comings and goings I finally decided which career I want to follow;

This is a repository just to finally start being a little more "official" programmer, I was learning python in 2020, a good competitive player at codingame... but I stopped just to start at my college;

In my city it doesn't have computer science or another similar course, I was approved in 4 different universities, I was very happy, altough I can't study in another city, so I was discouraged to continue... and now I want to recover everything I lost and get better and better;

At the time of writing this readme, I am learning Javascript, I love artificial intelligence and machine learning, which will have to wait as I currently want to work with fullstack web design and development.

I've never used github, and it's sad because i lost so many python projects, so now will be my first steps in git
