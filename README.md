**‚ú®&nbsp;&nbsp;About&nbsp;Me**

My name is Henrique Alexandre, I'm currently 20 years old, and I was born in a country town called Pitanga, where I currently live. I have a brother who has always been a reference for me in programming, and after many comings and goings, I finally decided which career I want to follow.

This is a repository just to finally start being a little more "official" programmer. I was learning Python in 2020 and was a good competitive player at CodinGame, but I stopped just to start college.

My city doesn't have a computer science or any similar course, and although I was approved in four different universities, I couldn't study in another city, so I was discouraged to continue. Now, I want to recover everything I lost and get better and better.

At the time of writing this readme, I am learning Javascript. I love artificial intelligence and machine learning, but they will have to wait as I currently want to work with full-stack web design and development.

I've never used Github, and it's sad because I lost so many Python projects. Now, I'm taking my first steps in Git.
