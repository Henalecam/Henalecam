## ‚ú® About Me

My name is Henrique Alexandre, I'm currently 20 years old, and I was born in a country town called Pitanga. I have a brother who has always been a reference for me in programming, and after many comings and goings, I finally decided which career I want to follow.

Currently working as **Fullstack Developer Mid-Level at Novi Sistemas (Node.js, Adonis)** and **Software Architect at Bonet & Cia LTDA (Ruby)**.

This is a repository just to finally start being a little more "official" programmer. I was learning Python in 2020 and was a good competitive player at CodinGame, but I stopped just to start college.
